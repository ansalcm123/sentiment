suggest ideas with fifa world cup tweets(sentiment analysis)


ChatGPT said:
Here are some project ideas that combine FIFA World Cup tweets with sentiment analysis, suitable for academic, internship, or portfolio purposes:

🔍 1. Fan Sentiment Tracker by Country
Idea: Analyze tweets related to FIFA World Cup and group them by the country the fan supports. Show how sentiment varies over time (e.g., before/during/after matches).

Insights you can show:

Most optimistic countries before the tournament

Sentiment drop after losing a match

Peak joy moments by country

📊 2. Live Sentiment Dashboard During Matches
Idea: Use Twitter data (historical or real-time) to show a live dashboard of fan emotions during FIFA matches.

Features:

Sentiment timeline minute by minute

Emoji cloud or word cloud during the game

Compare teams’ fan sentiment in real time

⚽ 3. Player-Specific Sentiment
Idea: Track sentiment for individual players like Messi, Ronaldo, Mbappé, etc., based on tweets mentioning them during the World Cup.

Visualizations:

Sentiment line graph for each match

Compare two players side by side

Show how fans react to goals, penalties, red cards

📰 4. Media vs Fan Sentiment
Idea: Compare sentiment in official FIFA/ESPN/Sports news tweets vs general public tweets.

Goal: Find discrepancies between media hype and actual fan opinion.

🗺️ 5. Geo-Sentiment Heatmap
Idea: If location data is available (from tweet metadata), visualize global fan sentiment on a map.

Use Case: Identify most emotionally invested regions by tweet tone (e.g., happy in Argentina, angry in Germany after a loss)

🎯 6. Predict Match Outcome from Sentiment
Idea: Use pre-match tweet sentiment as input to predict the match result (Win/Draw/Loss).

ML Task: Binary/Multiclass classification
Input: Sentiment polarity, tweet volume, etc.
Output: Match outcome

🧠 7. Troll vs Real Fan Classifier
Idea: Use sentiment and text features to classify whether a tweet is a genuine fan reaction or a sarcastic/trolling one.

Bonus: Use sarcasm detection model

🏆 8. Emotion Peaks & Match Events Correlation
Idea: Align tweets’ emotion spikes with actual events (goals, penalties, injuries) in FIFA matches.

Outcome: Timeline chart showing tweet spikes and match milestones.

📱 9. Team Sentiment Comparison Tool
Idea: Build an interactive web app where users select two national teams and compare:

Tweet volume

Sentiment polarity

Fan confidence before knockout matches

🤖 10. Chatbot that Predicts Team Morale
Idea: Based on the sentiment analysis of recent tweets, create a chatbot that tells you the "current fan morale" of any team.

Example Output:

“Brazil fans are 76% optimistic today after yesterday's 3-0 win!”

If you're interested in how to start, I can guide you on:

Where to get World Cup tweets (Kaggle/academic datasets)

Sentiment analysis using models like VADER or BERT

Plotting sentiment trends (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Building dashboards with Streamlit or Gradio

Would you like help with one specific idea from above?

read this dataset and give ideas according to it


ChatGPT said:
Thanks! Based on the dataset structure, here are some smart, tailored project ideas for sentiment analysis using the fifa_world_cup_2022_tweets.csv dataset:

📁 Dataset Overview:
Date Created: Timestamp of the tweet

Number of Likes: Popularity indicator

Source of Tweet: Device or app used (e.g., iPhone, Android, Web)

Tweet: Tweet text

Sentiment: Labeled as positive, neutral, or negative

💡 Project Ideas Based on This Dataset
1. 📈 Sentiment Timeline of World Cup 2022
Goal: Visualize how public sentiment evolved over the tournament (by date/hour).
Steps:

Convert Date Created to datetime

Group by day or hour

Count sentiment classes per time interval

Plot line chart or stacked bar chart

📊 Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly

2. 🥇 Most Liked Tweets by Sentiment
Goal: Identify and display the top positive, top negative, and top neutral tweets based on the number of likes.

Bonus: Use wordcloud or TF-IDF to analyze key words from each sentiment class.

3. 🧾 Source-wise Sentiment Analysis
Goal: Explore how sentiment varies by tweet source:
(e.g., do Android users post more negative tweets than iPhone users?)

Steps:

Group by Source of Tweet and Sentiment

Create a stacked bar plot or pie chart

4. 📊 Daily Sentiment Trends
Goal: Create a daily sentiment summary dashboard:

% of positive, negative, and neutral tweets per day

Number of tweets per day

Most common tweet source per day

Use Streamlit or Tableau for a dashboard-style output.

5. 📍 Top Hashtags & Their Sentiment
Goal: Extract hashtags from tweets and analyze their associated sentiments.
(e.g., is #Messi mostly positive?)

Bonus: Display a sentiment heatmap for trending hashtags.

6. 🧠 Build a Sentiment Classifier
Goal: Use the text of tweets to train your own sentiment classifier.

Steps:

Use the labeled data as a supervised dataset

Preprocess text (remove links, mentions, emojis, etc.)

Train using models like:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

BERT or RoBERTa (for advanced version)

7. 📉 Negative Sentiment Spike Detector
Goal: Identify timestamps where negative sentiment spiked (possibly during bad match decisions or losses).

Add-on: Fetch events from news APIs or World Cup match logs and compare.

8. 💬 Topic Modeling per Sentiment
Goal: Discover the main topics people tweeted about under each sentiment.

Method:

Filter tweets by sentiment

Apply LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic extraction

9. 🔍 Sarcasm/Emotion Detector (Advanced)
Goal: Detect sarcasm or deeper emotions within the tweets.
Method: Fine-tune on an emotion-labeled dataset or use pre-trained transformers.

10. 🎥 Animated Sentiment Map Over Time
Goal: Create a time-lapse animation showing how positive, neutral, and negative sentiments fluctuate day-by-day across the World Cup.

Output: GIF or HTML video chart

Would you like help picking one and getting started with code step-by-step? 








You said:
can make like whether the tweet is negative or not


ChatGPT said:
Yes! You can definitely turn this into a binary classification problem — predicting whether a tweet is negative or not.

✅ New Target Variable: is_negative
We’ll create a new column like this:

python
Copy
Edit
df['is_negative'] = df['Sentiment'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'negative' else 0)
This makes it a binary classification problem, where:

1 = Negative sentiment

0 = Not negative (i.e., positive or neutral)

✅ Project Idea: "Negative Tweet Detector for FIFA World Cup"
🧠 Problem Statement:
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a World Cup tweet expresses a negative sentiment.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Plan (Basic ML Approach)
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Remove links, mentions, hashtags

Lowercase

Tokenize

Remove stopwords

2. Feature Extraction
Use TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert tweet text into numbers

3. Train/Test Split
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = <processed_tweet_features>
y = df['is_negative']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
4. Model Training
Use any classifier:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
5. Evaluation
Check accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Bonus Ideas:
Visualize most common words in negative vs non-negative tweets

Show examples of misclassified tweets

Add "Number of Likes" as a numeric feature

Would you like me to start implementing this (step-by-step in Google Colab or here)? Or generate full code for you to run?

Updated saved memory
Great! Since this is your first machine learning project and you want to follow the PDF structure carefully, I’ll help you step-by-step in Google Colab, using your FIFA World Cup tweet dataset instead of the IMDB one.

We'll build the full Sentiment Analysis Project using:

Your dataset ✅

The instructions from the PDF ✅

Beginner-friendly code and explanations ✅

🚀 Let's Begin Your Project: FIFA Tweet Sentiment Analysis
🔧 Step 0: Setup Project Folder Structure (as per the PDF)
We'll create these folders in Colab:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
sentiment-analysis-project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── models/
├── notebooks/
Now, let’s write the setup code 👇

python
Copy
Edit
# Run this in Google Colab
import os

# Create folder structure
base_dir = "/content/sentiment-analysis-project"
folders = [
    "data/raw",
    "data/processed",
    "models",
    "notebooks"
]

for folder in folders:
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(base_dir, folder), exist_ok=True)

print("✅ Project structure created!")
📁 Step 1: Upload Dataset to Colab
Run this code to upload your dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
Upload the CSV file: fifa_world_cup_2022_tweets.csv

Then move it to the raw data folder:

python
Copy
Edit
import shutil

# Move uploaded file to raw folder
shutil.move("fifa_world_cup_2022_tweets.csv", base_dir + "/data/raw/fifa_tweets.csv")

print("✅ Dataset moved to raw folder")
📊 Step 2: Data Exploration Notebook (01_data_exploration.ipynb)
Now let’s begin with Notebook 1 — Data Exploration.

📥 Load and Inspect Data
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv(base_dir + "/data/raw/fifa_tweets.csv")

print("📊 FIFA Tweet Sentiment Analysis - Data Exploration")
print("=" * 50)
print("📈 Shape:", df.shape)
print("📋 Columns:", df.columns.tolist())
print("❓ Missing Values:\n", df.isnull().sum())
df.head()
📊 Sentiment Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
# Count sentiment values
sentiment_counts = df['Sentiment'].value_counts()

# Bar + Pie Charts
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))

sentiment_counts.plot(kind='bar', ax=ax1, color=['lightblue', 'salmon', 'lightgreen'])
ax1.set_title("Sentiment Distribution (Bar Chart)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Tweet Count")

ax2.pie(sentiment_counts, labels=sentiment_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%',
        colors=['lightblue', 'salmon', 'lightgreen'])
ax2.set_title("Sentiment Distribution (Pie Chart)")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
📏 Text Length Analysis
python
Copy
Edit
df['review_length'] = df['Tweet'].str.len()
df['word_count'] = df['Tweet'].str.split().str.len()

# Show summary
df.groupby('Sentiment')[['review_length', 'word_count']].describe()
Would you like me to help you:

Continue with Notebook 2: Preprocessing, or

Bundle all of the above into a ready-to-run Colab notebook, or

Assist with uploading the dataset in Colab first?

Let’s proceed step-by-step at your pace ✅








You said:
import shutil

# Define base_dir
base_dir = "/content"

# Move uploaded file to raw folder
shutil.move("fifa_world_cup_2022_tweets.csv", base_dir + "/fifa_world_cup_2022_tweets.csv")

print("✅ Dataset moved to raw folder")


ChatGPT said:
You're almost there — but if you're following the project structure from the PDF, the file should be moved to this folder:

swift
Copy
Edit
/content/sentiment-analysis-project/data/raw/
So you just need to update your path slightly.

✅ Corrected Code:
python
Copy
Edit
import shutil

# Define correct base_dir
base_dir = "/content/sentiment-analysis-project"

# Move uploaded file to raw folder
shutil.move("fifa_world_cup_2022_tweets.csv", base_dir + "/data/raw/fifa_tweets.csv")

print("✅ Dataset moved to data/raw folder")
✅ This will match the folder structure expected by your notebook code.

After this, you're ready to run Step 2: Data Exploration Notebook using the file located at:

python
Copy
Edit
"/content/sentiment-analysis-project/data/raw/fifa_tweets.csv"
Let me know if you want me to walk you through the Data Exploration part now, or help you start a .ipynb file version for submission.

Would you like me to:

✅ Bundle everything into .ipynb notebook files you can download

📤 Show how to convert notebooks to PDF for submission

🧪 Guide you with a second project idea for your internship

except:
    print("❌ Error loading model/vectorizer. Please check the path.") is this right?


ChatGPT said:
You're very close — but there's a small mistake in the file you're loading:

❌ Issue:
You're trying to load both the model and the vectorizer from the same file:

python
Copy
Edit
joblib.load("/content/logistic_regression.pkl")
But in your earlier step, we saved:

the model as logistic_regression.pkl

the TF-IDF vectorizer separately as tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

✅ Corrected Version:
python
Copy
Edit
# 📦 Import
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import joblib
import re
import nltk

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display, clear_output

# 📥 Load the trained model and vectorizer
try:
    model = joblib.load("/content/logistic_regression.pkl")
    tfidf = joblib.load("/content/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
    print("✅ Model and TF-IDF vectorizer loaded successfully")
except:
    print("❌ Error loading model/vectorizer. Please check the path.")
📌 Optional:
If you're following the PDF file structure, the model is usually saved like this:

python
Copy
Edit
# Example from our previous save
model_path = "/content/sentiment-analysis-project/models/best_model_logistic_regression.pkl"
vectorizer_path = "/content/sentiment-analysis-project/models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl"
So you could also update the paths to:

python
Copy
Edit
model = joblib.load("/content/sentiment-analysis-project/models/best_model_logistic_regression.pkl")
tfidf = joblib.load("/content/sentiment-analysis-project/models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
Let me know if you'd like to test the full interactive widget next or want help exporting your .ipynb file for submission!

You're very close again, but there's a confusion in naming the vectorizer file.

Let’s break it down:

❌ Problem in This Line:
python
Copy
Edit
vectorizer_path = "/content/logistic_regression.pkl"
This line mistakenly gives the TF-IDF vectorizer the same name as the model. This will overwrite your model file!

✅ Corrected Version:
Give the vectorizer a separate, meaningful name, like tfidf_vectorizer.pkl.

python
Copy
Edit
# Save model and TF-IDF vectorizer

model_path = f"/content/{best_model_name.lower().replace(' ', '_')}.pkl"
vectorizer_path = "/content/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl"

joblib.dump(best_model, model_path)
joblib.dump(tfidf, vectorizer_path)

print(f"💾 Saved model to: {model_path}")
print(f"💾 Saved vectorizer to: {vectorizer_path}")
✅ Example Output:
If your best model was "Logistic Regression", this will save:

Model ➜ /content/logistic_regression.pkl

Vectorizer ➜ /content/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

Now your interactive demo can load both files correctly:

python
Copy
Edit
model = joblib.load("/content/logistic_regression.pkl")
tfidf = joblib.load("/content/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
Let me know if you want help packaging all this into .ipynb files for submission, or converting them to PDF.

You said:
now i want to deploy in hugging face


ChatGPT said:
Awesome! 🎉 Deploying your FIFA Tweet Sentiment Analyzer on Hugging Face Spaces is a great idea — it gives you a free hosted app with a public link that you can share.

Let me guide you step-by-step as a beginner.

🚀 Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio
✅ Step 1: Prepare Required Files
You need these files in your GitHub/Hugging Face repo:

app.py – your Gradio app script

logistic_regression.pkl – trained model

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl – vectorizer

requirements.txt – to install dependencies on Hugging Face

✅ Step 2: Create app.py
Here is your app.py:

python
Copy
Edit
import joblib
import gradio as gr
import re
import nltk

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Download NLTK data (ensure this works on Spaces)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Load model and vectorizer
model = joblib.load("logistic_regression.pkl")
tfidf = joblib.load("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")

# Preprocessing
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+|www\S+', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()

    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [w for w in tokens if w not in stop_words and len(w) > 2]

    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in tokens]

    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Prediction function
def predict_sentiment(text):
    processed = preprocess_text(text)
    vectorized = tfidf.transform([processed])
    prediction = model.predict(vectorized)[0]
    proba = model.predict_proba(vectorized)[0]
    confidence = max(proba)
    return f"Prediction: {prediction}\nConfidence: {confidence:.2%}"

# Gradio interface
interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=predict_sentiment,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=4, placeholder="Enter FIFA tweet..."),
    outputs="text",
    title="⚽ FIFA Tweet Sentiment Analyzer",
    description="A simple ML model to predict sentiment of tweets from the FIFA World Cup."
)

# Launch for Spaces
if __name__ == "__main__":
    interface.launch()
✅ Step 3: Create requirements.txt
txt
Copy
Edit
gradio
joblib
nltk
scikit-learn
✅ (optional): add pandas or numpy if your app uses them.

✅ Step 4: Upload to Hugging Face
Go to 👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces

Click “Create New Space”

Choose:

Gradio

Public

Name your space (e.g., fifa-tweet-sentiment)

Upload these 4 files:

app.py

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

requirements.txt

Wait 1–2 minutes ⏳ for the app to build and launch

✅ Optional: Test locally before upload
If you want to test app.py locally in Colab first:

python
Copy
Edit
!pip install gradio
!python app.py
✅ Example Result:
Your app will be hosted at:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/fifa-tweet-sentiment

Would you like me to:

Create a ready-to-download .zip of all 4 files?

Or help you upload it live on Hugging Face with your account?

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl how to upload thse two?



2/2

ChatGPT said:
Great question! 🙌 Here are two beginner-friendly methods to upload your logistic_regression.pkl and tfidf_vectorizer.pkl files to your Hugging Face Space.

✅ Method 1: Upload from Your Local Computer (Easiest Way)
Go to your Hugging Face Space and open the Space you created

Click on the “Files and versions” tab (top-right)

Click the “Upload files” button

Upload:

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

After uploading, you’ll see the files appear in your Space’s directory

✅ Once done, your app.py will be able to load the files automatically like this:

python
Copy
Edit
model = joblib.load("logistic_regression.pkl")
tfidf = joblib.load("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
✅ Method 2: Upload via GitHub (if using GitHub repo)
If you're deploying from GitHub:

Place both .pkl files in the same folder as app.py in your GitHub repo

Push changes to GitHub

Connect the repo to your Hugging Face Space (or update it)

Hugging Face will auto-rebuild the app with those files

✅ How to Download These .pkl Files From Colab (if you trained there)
If your model/vectorizer are in Colab, you can download them to your PC:

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import files

# Download the files
files.download("logistic_regression.pkl")
files.download("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
Then go to Hugging Face → Files and Versions → Upload as in Method 1 ✅

Do you want me to generate a downloadable ZIP of all your files (app.py, requirements.txt, .pkl files)? I can package and send that for you.








You said:
https://ansalcm-sentiment-analyzer.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=ygR_tUYJB_g. when i upload the tweet the error is coming


ChatGPT said:
It looks like you're getting this error:

"Your space is in error, check its status on hf.co"

This typically means there's a problem in the backend of your HF Space. It might be working privately but failing when made public. This kind of issue is commonly reported by users using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces 
github.com
+2
discuss.huggingface.co
+2
github.com
+2
github.com
.

✅ What To Do Next
1. Check Space Logs
Go to your Space dashboard → "Settings" → "Logs"

Look for errors—like missing files, import issues, or runtime errors

These logs often point directly to the root cause

2. Common Issues to Verify
app.py is named correctly and doesn’t crash on startup

Required files (.pkl, etc.) are present and correctly named

requirements.txt includes all your dependencies (gradio, scikit-learn, nltk, etc.)

NLTK downloads (like punkt, stopwords, wordnet) succeed during startup

3. Use Factory Reset or Rebuild
In Settings, click "Reset Space" or "Rebuild space"

This clears caches and can resolve hidden build issues

4. Option: Keep Space Private Temporarily
Some users report public Spaces go into error mode, even if they run fine privately. You can:

Keep it private

Or embed the app in an external HTML page to bypass HF display issues 
discuss.huggingface.co

🛠️ Quick Testing Checklist
Item	✅ Done?
app.py correctly imports & loads model/vectorizer?	☐
All files (.pkl, requirements.txt) uploaded?	☐
NLTK downloads included in app.py?	☐
Rebuilt the Space after changes?	☐
Checked error logs in dashboard?	☐

📩 Still stuck?
Share key error messages from your logs—I'll help you debug

Or I can walk you through embedding your Space externally so users can still access it

Let me know what’s in your logs or what you'd like to do next!

You said:
both model is in xet format?


ChatGPT said:
Ah — good catch! If you're seeing something like “model is in .xet format” or Hugging Face logs mention .xet, it usually means:

❗ Problem: Files are not correctly uploaded
When you drag and drop large files or use Git LFS (Large File Storage) or the GitHub-integrated uploader, sometimes Hugging Face auto-converts them into .xet files or doesn't finalize the upload.

These .xet files are not real .pkl models — so joblib.load() will fail and cause your Space to break.

✅ Fix the Problem: Upload .pkl files properly
✅ Step-by-Step Fix:
Go to your Space → Click “Files and versions” tab

Delete any .xet files like:

logistic_regression.pkl.xet

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl.xet

Click “Upload files”

Upload the real .pkl files manually:

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

Make sure they end with .pkl, not .xet
If needed, re-download from Colab using:

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import files
files.download("logistic_regression.pkl")
files.download("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
Once uploaded, click “Rebuild Space” from Settings.

✅ How to Check If You Did It Right:
Go to your Space → Files tab

You should see:

Copy
Edit
app.py
logistic_regression.pkl
tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
requirements.txt
No .xet or partial uploads.

Would you like me to generate a .zip for you with all 4 files (app.py, .pkls, requirements.txt) for direct upload?








You said:


ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the photo! From your screenshot, we can clearly see the issue:

❌ Problem: .pkl files are uploaded as .xet format
These files:

logistic_regression.pkl (241 kB)

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl (405 kB)

⚠️ are actually not usable, because they are .xet stubs (Hugging Face proxy format when files are uploaded via Git LFS or GitHub incorrectly).

✅ Solution: Re-upload .pkl files manually using Hugging Face UI
Follow these exact steps to fix it:

🧼 Step 1: Delete the .xet files
Go to your Hugging Face Space: ansalcm/sentiment_analyzer

Click the "Files and versions" tab

Click the trash bin 🗑 next to:

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

(These are .xet format even though the names look right)

✅ Step 2: Upload the correct .pkl files
If you don’t have the files downloaded locally:

🔽 From Colab:
In your training notebook, run this:

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import files
files.download("logistic_regression.pkl")
files.download("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
Then:

In Hugging Face → go to "Files and versions"

Click “Upload files”

Select and upload:

✅ logistic_regression.pkl (real pickle file)

✅ tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

These should now appear as normal files, not .xet.

🔁 Step 3: Rebuild your Space
After uploading the files,

Click "Settings" → “Rebuild”

Then your Gradio app should launch normally 🎉

Would you like me to:

📦 Send a ZIP file with app.py, requirements.txt, and dummy models to help test locally?

✅ Or guide you step-by-step through testing the rebuild?

Let me know!








You said:

File
tfidf_vectorizer (1).pkl
File
ok?


ChatGPT said:
Perfect! ✅ You've just uploaded the correct .pkl files:

logistic_regression (1).pkl

tfidf_vectorizer (1).pkl

✅ Final Steps to Deploy Your App on Hugging Face Spaces
🧼 Step 1: Delete old .xet versions
Go to your Hugging Face Space:

Click "Files and versions"

Click the 🗑️ icon next to:

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
(These are .xet stubs and won’t work)

📤 Step 2: Upload the Correct .pkl Files
Click “Upload files”

Select:

logistic_regression (1).pkl

tfidf_vectorizer (1).pkl

After upload, rename them directly in Hugging Face to:

logistic_regression.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

✅ This ensures they match what's being loaded in your app.py:

python
Copy
Edit
model = joblib.load("logistic_regression.pkl")
tfidf = joblib.load("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")
🔁 Step 3: Rebuild the Space
Go to the Settings tab

Click “Rebuild Space”

After 1–2 minutes, your app should load and be ready to use 🎉

🚀 Bonus: Test It
Once deployed successfully, test with sample tweets like:

"Messi was incredible in the final!"

"That referee decision was awful!"

Need help packaging your full project (with README or ZIP)?
Or ready to submit this as Project 1 for your internship?

Thanks! ✅ The log reveals the exact issue:

❌ Problem: Missing NLTK Resource — punkt_tab
The error says:

LookupError: Resource punkt_tab not found.
Tried to tokenize text with word_tokenize(), but punkt_tab was missing.

This is a rare but known issue on Hugging Face Spaces because of how their servers cache downloads.

✅ Two-Step Fix:
✅ Step 1: Replace word_tokenize() with simple split()
You're not using sentence-level tokenization or complex grammar, so you don’t need word_tokenize().

Update this part in your app.py:

❌ Original:
python
Copy
Edit
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
✅ Replace With:
python
Copy
Edit
tokens = text.split()
This avoids the need for punkt or punkt_tab entirely. It's safe for your project.

✅ Step 2: Update app.py (Full Fix Version)
Here's the fixed app.py you can copy-paste into Hugging Face:

python
Copy
Edit
import joblib
import gradio as gr
import re
import nltk

from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Download necessary NLTK data
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Load model and vectorizer
model = joblib.load("logistic_regression.pkl")
tfidf = joblib.load("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl")

# Preprocessing
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+|www\S+', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()

    # Replaced word_tokenize() to avoid punkt error
    tokens = text.split()

    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stop_words and len(t) > 2]

    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in tokens]

    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Prediction function
def predict_sentiment(text):
    processed = preprocess_text(text)
    vectorized = tfidf.transform([processed])
    prediction = model.predict(vectorized)[0]
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(vectorized)[0]
    confidence = max(probabilities)

    return f"🧠 Prediction: {prediction}\n🔍 Confidence: {confidence:.2%}"

# Gradio UI
interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=predict_sentiment,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=4, placeholder="Enter a FIFA World Cup tweet..."),
    outputs="text",
    title="⚽ FIFA Tweet Sentiment Analyzer",
    description="Enter a tweet related to the FIFA World Cup to predict its sentiment using a trained ML model."
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    interface.launch()
✅ What To Do Now:
Replace your app.py on Hugging Face with the fixed version above

Click “Rebuild Space”

Wait ~30 seconds — then test your app again

Let me know once done — or I’ll send a downloadable .zip of the fixed files for you!

# ⚽ FIFA Tweet Sentiment Analyzer

This project is a simple Machine Learning web app that predicts the **sentiment of tweets related to the FIFA World Cup** (positive, neutral, or negative). Built using **Gradio**, **Scikit-learn**, and **NLTK**, this project was developed as part of an internship project on Sentiment Analysis.

![Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ansalcm/fifa-tweet-sentiment-analyzer/resolve/main/demo.gif) <!-- optional if you add a GIF or screenshot -->

## 🚀 Live App

👉 [Try the Sentiment Analyzer on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ansalcm/fifa-tweet-sentiment-analyzer)

## 📦 Technologies Used

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Input**: Preprocessed tweet text
- **Output**: Predicted sentiment (`positive`, `neutral`, or `negative`)
- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Tweet text is cleaned and preprocessed (lowercased, stopwords removed, lemmatized).
2. The text is vectorized using the TF-IDF model.
3. The trained model predicts the sentiment.
4. A confidence score is returned along with the prediction.

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Input**: Preprocessed tweet text
- **Output**: Predicted sentiment (`positive`, `neutral`, or `negative`)
- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Tweet text is cleaned and preprocessed (lowercased, stopwords removed, lemmatized).
2. The text is vectorized using the TF-IDF model.
3. The trained model predicts the sentiment.
4. A confidence score is returned along with the prediction.
